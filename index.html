        <h1>Game of Life</h1>
        <p>This is a vanilla Javascript implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, which is a cellular simulation with these rules : 
        </p> 
        <ul>
                <li class="death">A cell with less than 2 cell in its neighbourhood dies, as if by solitude</li>
                <li class="survival">A cell with 2 cells in its neighbourhood survives</li>
                <li class="death">A cell with 3 or more cells in its neighbourhood dies, as if by food scarcity</li>
                <li class="reproduction">An empty cell with just one cell in its neighbourhood gets populated, as if by reproduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click or drag on the canvas to add or remove cells, and use the controls below to play with the simulation.</p>
