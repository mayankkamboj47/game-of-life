        <h1>Game of Life</h1>
        <p>This is a Javascript implementation of Conway's Game of Life, which is a cellular simulation with these rules : 
        </p> 
        <ul>
                <li>A cell with less than 2 cell in its neighbourhood dies, as if by solitude</li>
                <li>A cell with 2 cells in its neighbourhood survives</li>
                <li>A cell with 3 or more cells in its neighbourhood dies, as if by food scarcity</li>
                <li>An empty cell with just one cell in its neighbourhood gets populated, as if by reproduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on the canvas to add or remove cells, and use the controls below to play with the simulation.</p>
